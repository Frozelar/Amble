# Platformer-Project
Random game being made with C++ and SDL, as well as Lua scripts.

This is my first serious attempt at making an actual working game.  The initial version isn't ready to be built yet; I just wanted to make a repository so as to not lose my progress if my computer should die or something.
Don't, like, steal my code.  Or something.
