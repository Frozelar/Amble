Random game being made with C++ and SDL, as well as Lua scripts.

This is my first serious attempt at making an actual working game. I'm envisioning some sort of open-world platformer sort of thing, similar to Super Metroid or An Untitled Story. Whether or not it actually ends up that way, though, is completely up in the air. Don't, like, steal my code. Or something.
